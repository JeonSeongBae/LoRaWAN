Project : Wireless Network Infrastructure for Emergency Services and Remote Event Location Services

Detail : The Agricultural market sector is one of the most promising areas to reap the benefits of IoT
technologies. This project will examine the IoT ecosystem and apply it in an agricultural
environment. From the various sensors used to monitor environmental conditions, to the
complex networks used for data transport, to the systems used to store and analyze the large
information collected, we will develop a prototype system for crop monitoring and feeding.
Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing, implementing, and comparing the various
wireless networks that are emerging in this area for sensor connectivity and aggregate
transport of data to offsite locations. After building a proof of concept system, time permitting,
we will implement it on an actual working farm. Alternative rural energy systems may also be
explored
and implemented to power the system at remote locations.
